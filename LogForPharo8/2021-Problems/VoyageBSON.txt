In fact, in you slide presentation C019-W4S11-Voyage, you propose to use a Symbol for the level (slide 10/27). Level must be a string. Symbol in MongoDB is code 14 (which is deprected now), the BSON code is now 2 (string). Then in slide 14, replace #epic by 'epic'. If not the next version of Voyage will raise an error. Same point for the slide 16, the epic in the selectMany is a string.
Hope this can help.
