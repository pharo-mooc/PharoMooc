1
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,110
If you are either a beginner or 
an expert in object-oriented programming

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,970
you will love this MOOC because
it will change the way you program with objects.

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,310
I am Stéphane Ducasse, with
Luc Fabresse and Damien Cassou,

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,090
we will present this
MOOC about Pharo.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:19,970
What is Pharo? 

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,970
Pharo is a dynamic and pure language
that will offer you

7
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:25,490
a unique development experience
in which you will be 

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,459
in constant interaction
with live objects.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,900
Pharo is a language and an open source
environment in the tradition of Smalltalk.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,640
It is fun to use,
elegant and very powerful.

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,600
Why do I say that
Pharo is elegant?

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,590
In fact, it is very simple:
its full syntax, and I insist

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,529
on “full”, can be written
on a postcard and its object-oriented

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,900
model written in 4 lines. 
Moreover, Pharo and its environment are

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,220
written in Pharo itself exclusively 
with objects and messages.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,310
All these points make Pharo
very easy to learn and

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,670
once you have understood the syntax,
you will have access to

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,400
the whole Pharo world, hence it is written 
in Pharo itself.


19
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,780
That is why Pharo is
used in about thirty

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,700
universities all over the world
to teach object-oriented programing.

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,700
In this MOOC, you will
discover that Pharo is fun.

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,820
In fact, when programing in Pharo,
you are immersed in a world of 

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,230
live objects. Each time 
the programer modifies 

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,610
its code, the 3D animation changes
and he can see immediately

25
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,200
the result of its program.

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,080
In Pharo, the programer modifies continuously
objects with immediate feedback.

27
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,630
These objects can represent web 
applications, graphics in 2D,

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,630
in 3D, network,
or even code itself.

29
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,400
You will see that in Pharo
everything is object.

30
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,930
In this MOOC, you will discover
that Pharo is also a powerful

31
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,370
language, used in companies.

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,550
And you can discover
some success stories


33
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,590
on Pharo’s website.

34
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,520
In this MOOC, we will also
present Pharo’s web stack.

35
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,850
and how this stack revolutionizes
the way web applications

36
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,340
are designed. 
During this MOOC, you will deploy

37
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,590
a web application fully written
in Pharo.

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,450
Beyond this, we will revisit
fundamental principles

39
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,560
of programing by illustrating
how Pharo uses them.

40
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,460
We will present some coding idioms
and design patterns

41
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,620
to better design web applications.

42
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,540
Such concepts can be applied
to any object-oriented language

43
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,250
beyond Pharo.

44
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,750
Moreover, you will have access to 
many resources such as

45
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,370
the book “Pharo by example” which is
available on Pharo’s website.

46
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,480
For the most experienced of you,
this MOOC will provide a new

47
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,200
vision of the fundamental principles
of object-oriented programming

48
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,540
(i.e. late binding 
and polymorphism).

49
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,520
Through out this MOOC come and 
discover or rediscover object-oriented

50
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,900
programing in a different world,
the world of Pharo…
