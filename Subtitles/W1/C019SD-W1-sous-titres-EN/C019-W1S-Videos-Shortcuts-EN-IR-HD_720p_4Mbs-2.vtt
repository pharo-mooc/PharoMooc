00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.230 align:middle
In this session, I’d like
to show you

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.310 align:middle
menus, and in particular the main
operations,

00:00:07.477 --> 00:00:08.770 align:middle
but what I’d like to do also
is to show you how to 

00:00:08.937 --> 00:00:12.670 align:middle
learn keyboard shortcuts linked 
to this menu.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.750 align:middle
In Pharo, if you go in “Settings”,

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:21.400 align:middle
you will have the reminder shortcut,
we set it on “true”

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:23.630 align:middle
and you will see what it does.
For instance, when I type 

00:00:23.797 --> 00:00:28.150 align:middle
1 + 2 and I use the Print menus,
ah!

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:30.430 align:middle
All of a sudden, the system 
displays this little window

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle
showing that I should use
cmd + P instead of the menu.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle
So that’s what we are going to do 
from now. 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.210 align:middle
So I do cmd + P and here it is: 
I get my result.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle
So now, I’d like to show you

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:45.230 align:middle
the difference between “Do it”,
“Print it”.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle
Then we will see “Inspect it”
and “Do it and go”.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.820 align:middle
So "Do it", basically it is cmd + D,

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.260 align:middle
here I’ve done it, 
you didn’t see it but

00:00:57.427 --> 00:00:59.600 align:middle
it means that I execute the expression,
I don’t care about the result.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.070 align:middle
"Print it" means I execute 
the expression and I display the result.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle
So let’s imagine now that we
have “Workspace open”, 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle
if I do

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle
“Do it”, it opens, it executes 
the message and it shows

00:01:20.627 --> 00:01:23.050 align:middle
me there, it opens the Workspace.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.950 align:middle
Now, if I do “Print it”, what do
I get?

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.200 align:middle
I get a Workspace which is the graphical 
representation of the result.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.100 align:middle
Now I can do something more
interesting, 

00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:36.100 align:middle
I can do "Inspect it".

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle
What will ”Inspect it"
do?

00:01:42.017 --> 00:01:44.510 align:middle
It will execute the expression,
so I get a

00:01:44.677 --> 00:01:47.780 align:middle
Workspace, and it will open
a special tool

00:01:47.947 --> 00:01:51.570 align:middle
enabling me to browse inside and to see, 
to interact with this object.

00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:53.720 align:middle
Here it is a quite complex object
so I won’t go 
33
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,790
and see inside,
it is just to show you.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.940 align:middle
In the same way, something very powerful
is cmd + I.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.380 align:middle
Now, the last one is 
"Do it and go".

00:02:06.547 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle
"Do it and go" means execute it
and open an inspector

00:02:09.757 --> 00:02:14.390 align:middle
but open it inside this window

00:02:14.557 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle
so that there is not several windows.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle
And it will enable you to browse.

00:02:17.497 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle
So here for example, if I click on 
"bindings", I don’t know what

00:02:20.857 --> 00:02:22.600 align:middle
it is precisely.
Ok, it is a dictionary.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.940 align:middle
You see there is a little
navigation window which enables

00:02:26.107 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle
to see the elements and to 
go backward, to say

00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:31.460 align:middle
I don’t want to see this
or I can browse and go into

00:02:31.627 --> 00:02:33.340 align:middle
the system and see for instance
the keys, 

00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:34.140 align:middle
there are none for “bindings” 
for example.
