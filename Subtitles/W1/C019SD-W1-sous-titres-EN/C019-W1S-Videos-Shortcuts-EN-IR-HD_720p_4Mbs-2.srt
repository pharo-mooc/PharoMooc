1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,230
In this session, I’d like
to show you

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,310
menus, and in particular the main
operations,

3
00:00:07,477 --> 00:00:08,770
but what I’d like to do also
is to show you how to 

4
00:00:08,937 --> 00:00:12,670
learn keyboard shortcuts linked 
to this menu.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,750
In Pharo, if you go in “Settings”,

6
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:21,400
you will have the reminder shortcut,
we set it on “true”

7
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:23,630
and you will see what it does.
For instance, when I type 

8
00:00:23,797 --> 00:00:28,150
1 + 2 and I use the Print menus,
ah!

9
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:30,430
All of a sudden, the system 
displays this little window

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,410
showing that I should use
cmd + P instead of the menu.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,820
So that’s what we are going to do 
from now. 

12
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,210
So I do cmd + P and here it is: 
I get my result.

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,110
So now, I’d like to show you

14
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,230
the difference between “Do it”,
“Print it”.

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,670
Then we will see “Inspect it”
and “Do it and go”.

16
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,820
So "Do it", basically it is cmd + D,

17
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,260
here I’ve done it, 
you didn’t see it but

18
00:00:57,427 --> 00:00:59,600
it means that I execute the expression,
I don’t care about the result.

19
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:05,070
"Print it" means I execute 
the expression and I display the result.

20
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:11,000
So let’s imagine now that we
have “Workspace open”, 

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,470
if I do

22
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,460
“Do it”, it opens, it executes 
the message and it shows

23
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:23,050
me there, it opens the Workspace.

24
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,950
Now, if I do “Print it”, what do
I get?

25
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,200
I get a Workspace which is the graphical 
representation of the result.

26
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,100
Now I can do something more
interesting, 

27
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:36,100
I can do "Inspect it".

28
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,850
What will ”Inspect it"
do?

29
00:01:42,017 --> 00:01:44,510
It will execute the expression,
so I get a

30
00:01:44,677 --> 00:01:47,780
Workspace, and it will open
a special tool

31
00:01:47,947 --> 00:01:51,570
enabling me to browse inside and to see, 
to interact with this object.

32
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,720
Here it is a quite complex object
so I won’t go 
33
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,790
and see inside,
it is just to show you.

34
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,940
In the same way, something very powerful
is cmd + I.

35
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,380
Now, the last one is 
"Do it and go".

36
00:02:06,547 --> 00:02:09,590
"Do it and go" means execute it
and open an inspector

37
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:14,390
but open it inside this window

38
00:02:14,557 --> 00:02:15,670
so that there is not several windows.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,330
And it will enable you to browse.

40
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:20,690
So here for example, if I click on 
"bindings", I don’t know what

41
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:22,600
it is precisely.
Ok, it is a dictionary.

42
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,940
You see there is a little
navigation window which enables

43
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:28,190
to see the elements and to 
go backward, to say

44
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,460
I don’t want to see this
or I can browse and go into

45
00:02:31,627 --> 00:02:33,340
the system and see for instance
the keys, 

46
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:34,140
there are none for “bindings” 
for example.
