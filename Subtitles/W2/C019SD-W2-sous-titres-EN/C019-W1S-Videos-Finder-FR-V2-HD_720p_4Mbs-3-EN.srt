00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,160
hello, I’d like to show you
how to use 

2
00:00:04,327 --> 00:00:05,690
the Finder to find information.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,010
The Finder is a tool you will 
find in

4
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:09,550
the Tools menu, here Finder.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,470
Let’s imagine I want to look for
a method

6
00:00:14,637 --> 00:00:16,750
called match.
I write its name, match.
qui s'appelle match.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,160
Here I choose Selectors.

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,060
Now I see all methods
containing

9
00:00:23,227 --> 00:00:28,000
the word match, with the code 
here.

10
00:00:28,157 --> 00:00:30,680
As I set up big fonts,
we wil

11
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:33,470
resize a little bit.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,460
You see that when there is a
little

13
00:00:36,627 --> 00:00:38,300
triangle, it means the method

14
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:41,930
is defined over several classes, 
and I can read that kind of thing.

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,450
So that was for methods, and 
there is quite a lot.

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,280
You can look for things 
but that’s not ideal.

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,000
Now we can search for

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,000
classes containing match,
here we see all our classes.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,230
The best way is to unbrowse
using the code browser.

20
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,880
Now there a far better way.

21
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,240
Often we know what we are 
looking for

22
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:08,410
but we don’t know how to express
it.

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,390
So here, I know that I’d
like to know if there

24
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:16,520
is a method matching ab,

25
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,380
abcd, for instance, I write
ab*abcd

26
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,360
and if something matches it returns
true.

27
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,710
And I choose Examples,
and I get all

28
00:01:29,877 --> 00:01:33,270
the methods returning True.

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,850
I’m going to explain what we
see.

30
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,790
Here I see that superior 
works as well.

31
00:01:36,957 --> 00:01:38,380
Ah, match seems interesting.

32
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,510
The system shows me all

33
00:01:42,677 --> 00:01:45,230
the classes defining
the match method, but 

34
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,630
in particular the one with the
little star is the one

35
00:01:47,797 --> 00:01:49,200
which method has returned true.

36
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,080
So now, we can try other examples.

37
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:56,000
For example, given 11, 2

38
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:59,810
what methods returns 5. Here
I will have

39
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,300
// and I see what has

40
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:08,930
returned true, it’s defined
on Integer, so it is

41
00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:11,750
this method or on aNumber
which is this method there.

42
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
So I do the same, in the same way:

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,100
Now I want 5.5.
Then I only get Diviser.

44
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,390
So it’s very useful.
45
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,350
There another way to do it:

46
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:26,910
you can look for 

47
00:02:27,077 --> 00:02:30,040
all the Pragmas, Pragmas
are the annotations

48
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,210
in the system. So if I 
look what is an 

49
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:34,920
annotation, for instance it is
this.

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,910
Here it is, I have annotated
my method with a pragma named

51
00:02:39,077 --> 00:02:41,460
Menu, and the system can
make queries on it 

52
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:44,780
to build menus.
Here by typing Menu, and

53
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:49,890
selecting Pragma,
I can access to all the system’s

54
00:02:50,057 --> 00:02:52,910
pragmas containing the menu
word.

55
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,320
So here, we see that there are 2
for instance, 2 pragmas.

56
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,400
The worldMenu, the one which is
displayed 

57
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:07,420
when you are here, is defined
by the Pragma menu.

58
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,670
You see worldMenu.

59
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,000
The screenShotCommand
for example. HelpOn.

60
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:19,520
You see all these menus.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,200
So know, with the Finder we 
can also

62
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,490
look for methods

63
00:03:28,657 --> 00:03:33,000
containing the “Menu” string,
wherever they are.

64
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:36,340
I’m gonna do it: it takes a little time.

65
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,650
What happens is that the system
scans

66
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:41,230
really all the body of all
the methods, there are

67
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:45,320
80 000 in Pharo, or a little 
bit more, and it displays the result.

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,500
So here, it’s really a textual
search.

69
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,260
What’s interesting sometimes,
when you see

70
00:03:52,427 --> 00:03:54,600
a menu or something graphical
you can find it back. 

71
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,900
So here, you have all the 
methods containing the

72
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:03,300
Menu word, in their names
as well as

73
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:07,080
elsewhere, here or there.
