00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,920
In this video, I’d like 
to show you that we can

2
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:05,590
browse, compute the differences 
between the 

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,000
committed package versions
on a repository.

4
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:12,730
Here, I’m gonna use a local
repository.

5
00:00:12,897 --> 00:00:15,170
So this means that if you don’t 
use Small Talk hub and

6
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:16,760
and you work with a team,
you can compute

7
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:21,240
the differences and merges of codes that 
you can share with others.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,620
I use Monticello, 
this is why I have in fact

9
00:00:26,787 --> 00:00:30,190
versioned many versions 
of this package.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,800
I open, I click on Open.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,960
Here, I see all the versions

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,633
of my package.

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,190
Now if I consider the last
version, 

14
00:00:41,357 --> 00:00:44,120
I can browse, it means I 
want to see

15
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:46,260
what is inside the package
which is on the repository.

16
00:00:46,427 --> 00:00:49,050
If I do “Browse”, you see that
I have the very last

17
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:53,000
package version.

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,060
And it shows the extensions:
“You are extending this.”

19
00:00:55,227 --> 00:00:55,860

20
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:57,430
Now if I consider an older 
version, like

21
00:00:57,597 --> 00:01:00,640
this one, and I browse, 
we will see that I only

22
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:04,060
have 2 classes left and 
I haven’t any extensions.

23
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:07,360
You already see, I can
look at what

24
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,930
is published on a server and
go and see the content inside.

25
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,750
Now in my image,
I have the latest version so

26
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:17,160
I can compare the changes.

27
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,270
It means that I can see
“Give me the changes

28
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:23,930
between this image and what is
loaded in the system.”

29
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,240
The system warns us: 
“Careful, if you

30
00:01:27,407 --> 00:01:30,930
load this package, it will 
suppress all these methods”,

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,820
and obviously I want to see 
the methods.

32
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,350
Now I can, 
when using the “history button”,

33
00:01:35,517 --> 00:01:39,850
for example if I want to
know what

34
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,670
has happened between version 7
and version 4.

35
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,330
I choose version 7, I click on 
History, it

36
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:48,540
shows me several versions.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,090
I go from version 4, so I
select

38
00:01:51,257 --> 00:01:53,520
version 4 and I say
“I want to see

39
00:01:53,687 --> 00:01:55,170
the changes 
to version 7.”

40
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,400
And here, it shows
“Here is what you have done.”

41
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,160
So obviously, here I have only
added things

42
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:03,910
but if I had modified, for 
example, if I had modified

43
00:02:04,077 --> 00:02:08,210
a method category and protocol,
it would show

44
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,300
me all the changes. 

45
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,170
In the same way, if I want to see
what happened 

46
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,890
between version 11 and

47
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,360
version 8 for instance…

48
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:24,130
here I added + and
that kind of thing.

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,770
You can see that in Pharo you
have all the tools 

50
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:31,490
allowing you to manage a project
with several members.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,100
Further more, you will have 
all the access rights managed 

52
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:36,550
by the different systems,
such as Small Talk Hub or

53
00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:40,460
Squick Source, and you can
work in group very

54
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,820
on Pharo.
By the way, this is how

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,620
Pharo itself is being developped.
