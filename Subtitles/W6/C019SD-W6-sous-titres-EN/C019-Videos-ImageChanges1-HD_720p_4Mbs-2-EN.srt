1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:03,440
In this video, I'd like to
explain a little bit

2
00:00:03,607 --> 00:00:06,480
Pharo's different packaging
ways, in order for 

3
00:00:06,647 --> 00:00:08,640
not to get lost in the future.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,400
When you install Pharo, you will
normally click on a link

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,370
given, but if you go on 
Pharo,

6
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:17,280
the release at the moment 
of this video

7
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:21,060
is version 4, but version 5 will
be exactly the same.

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,370
When I downloaded Mac OSX version,
I get this zip.

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,090
If I unzip this zip,
I get what I call Pharo4 app.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,460
When I launch
Pharo 4 app, I get Pharo.

11
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:36,410
Let's imagine we write

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,380
"Hello". When I save, 
it will save the environment.

13
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,430
I click on Save.

14
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,920
If I click on Quit now,
I will launch it again,

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,100
and I will have exactly
"Hello", because saving the Pharo

16
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:03,810
image is making a memory copy
with all the

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,780
objects included Bytecode objects
and compiled methods.

18
00:01:07,947 --> 00:01:11,920
What is there in 

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,400
this application?

20
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:16,750
On Mac, we can what is inside.

21
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,620
If I click on Show Contents,
what will I see?

22
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,380
I'm going ti find a Pharo virtual
machine and ressources.

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,530
And here, I will find a changes
file and an

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,913
image file.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,880
The image file is the one that
really contains

26
00:01:36,047 --> 00:01:39,840
the objects representing the memory,
and the changes file

27
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,760
is a file comprising all the 
incremental changes

28
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:46,680
done.
If I double-click

29
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,800
on the image file,

30
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,000
normally, depending on the
OS, I will launch it on

31
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,960
a Pharo virtual machine that
I have installed, it

32
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:05,900
will launch again my image file.

33
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,450
This image file,
what happens with it?

34
00:02:08,617 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's imagine I define a classe.

35
00:02:10,157 --> 00:02:12,050
I'm going to define a package,

36
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,733
"Add package" "ATest".

37
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,060
In this package,

38
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,300
I'm going to define 
"MyStrangeClass".

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,170
I define it and here, I put
"foooo" which returns

40
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,063
42.

41
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,750
If I save this image with
another name, I'm going

42
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:44,270
to save it with the name

43
00:02:44,437 --> 00:02:45,070
Pharo40Stef.

44
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,930
What did it do?

45
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:58,580
I quit. It created another
pair

46
00:02:58,747 --> 00:03:01,570
image and change. In this changes
file, we won't open it

47
00:03:01,737 --> 00:03:04,620
because it is not readable
by a human, there is

48
00:03:04,787 --> 00:03:07,110
the methods code I have just
created.

49
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:11,840
And if I launch again Pharo 4,
I'm gonna 

50
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:16,300
launch it using the virtual 
machine, I get

51
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,110
once more the snapshot, what
we call the system

52
00:03:22,277 --> 00:03:27,200
copy that I had done at a certain
moment

53
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,073
before.

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,790
Now, if I execute again
PharoStef image, what will it

55
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:33,590
do?

56
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:37,180
It will show me the system
with my new class.

57
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,920
The Pharo 4 application,
it is what we call a Mac

58
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:47,460
bundle which contains the Pharo
VM plus an image plus a change.

59
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,500
If I double-click on it, 
I don't have any choice, it 

60
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,950
will always choose Pharo image
because it is a script 

61
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,660
that has coded:
"Here it is, this is THAT image."

62
00:03:55,827 --> 00:03:59,430
In general, it is useful at 
the beginning of the use of

63
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:02,600
Pharo, but we do not use it.

64
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:05,840
In general, either we use an
instruction of the command

65
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:09,200
line which is something like

66
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,470
Pharo-ui with 
MyPharoImage.image

67
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:19,250
and this will

68
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:21,710
send the thing. Or if we use 
command line and we

69
00:04:21,877 --> 00:04:24,010
don't want to have the ui, we
will do that kind of things.

70
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,450
It means that Pharo is installed
somewhere in

71
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:30,130
your system as a standard Unix
application.

72
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,400
Now, you see on this page

73
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,930
that you can download a 
Pharo

74
00:04:39,097 --> 00:04:40,940
pair, you can
download a virtual machine.

75
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,560
We are gonna download the
virtual machine and

76
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:48,220
download an image pair
and also source.

77
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,830
I'm gonna explain what it is,
this way we will have the

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,460
3 at hand, we will play together.

79
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,760
Now if I unzip the file 
corresponding to

80
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,240
Pharo Image and
Changes, I get this one.

81
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,260
When I unzip, what do I get in 
Pharo in this file?

82
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:13,680
I get an image.

83
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,950
We will do it in a mode where
you can

84
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,070
see what is inside.

85
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,010
It means that this file, 
it is again an image pair

86
00:05:24,177 --> 00:05:27,660
corresponding to a certain 
state of the snapshot or of the

87
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:32,630
Pharo image, of the virtualised
system. Here, I can execute it

88
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:36,280
on the Pharo image.

89
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,120
I get a message, 
what is this message?

90
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,270
The system can work since
I can execute anything.

91
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,770
I can run it.

92
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:53,330
Now, I can do exactly what I 
did before.

93
00:05:53,497 --> 00:05:58,360
I can define MyPackage,
and in MyPackage

94
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,900
I will say MyStrangeClass.

95
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,220
So we start to be used to it.

96
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,580
I define a method:

97
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,520
fooo 42. It asks for my
login.

98
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,510
I can do as usual
"MyStrangeClass

99
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,050
new fooo" and I get 42.

100
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,600
So, very good. I can save.

101
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,360
I save it for example with 
another name, 

102
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:32,240
Stef, I name it
PharoStrange.

103
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:33,040
OK.

104
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,200
What does it say?

105
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:44,530
It says “I can’t find the source
file 

106
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,200
Pharo 4. 0." Why does it say this?

107
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,730
When I open the briwser, if I can
see for instance the 

108
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:58,670
AST code, this is not your code,
so we go at the top.

109
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:03,000
The reason why the system

110
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,000
doesn’t find the comments

111
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,180
is that it is decompiling.

112
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,730
So, we don’t see it because the methods
are

113
00:07:11,897 --> 00:07:13,420
too simple, but it decompiles
the code.

114
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:15,000
Let’s go on something more
concrete.

115
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:19,820
Here it decompiled the code,
the Bytecode represents an

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,620
an argument and it knows very well
that this is an argument.

117
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,440
But we lost the source.

118
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,870
In general, the sytem source,
when Pharo

119
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:33,530
is implemented, is stored in 
a file called Pharo 4 source

120
00:07:33,697 --> 00:07:36,290
that you can find here.

121
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,920
In genral Pharo 4

122
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:41,420
source will be installed once
on the system because

123
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,040
this file is on read only, 
and all your

124
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,030
applications can use it.

125
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,180
I have it here, I’m gonna unzipp it.

126
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:50,670
Here I have Pharo4.source.

127
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,840
If I quit without saving

128
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,060
and I relaunch the application,
here anyway you see

129
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:02,280
that it does exactly the same as
previously, it is to say

130
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,190
that when I save a snapshot 
giving it 

131
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:10,160
another name, I have once more
a system with 2 things:

132
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,620
the image and its changes.

133
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,650
Here if I take my old image,
there

134
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,780
is no more error because 
it has found the code and it

135
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:24,710
knows that it corresponds to 
the state there was

136
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,130
when we launched the first image.

137
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:28,640
Now if I use the second one,

138
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,960
if I consider the file
AST-Core, first

139
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:41,830
my classes have comments.

140
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,000
Here these are really the names
people gave. 

141
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,870
If we look at this architecture,
what do we have?

142
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,230
We have the source file
containing the system sources,

143
00:08:57,397 --> 00:09:02,000
in general, once the system is
compiled, the compiler 

144
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,610
doesn’t need the sources,

145
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:08,330
the virtual machine and 
image and change pairs.

146
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,180
Image contains all the objects
that have been defined plus

147
00:09:12,347 --> 00:09:14,790
the system objects,
with the changes files which

148
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:18,520
contains the deltas of what you’ve done
compared to the changes file.

149
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,430
Each time you save you system,
it is

150
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:25,260
as if you save a virtualised
image of your OS.

151
00:09:25,427 --> 00:09:26,730
This is exactly the same principle.

152
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,910
If you look inside the Pharo 4
application,

153
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
you will find those ressources.

154
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,730
I have the Pharo 4 sources, 
I have the image file,

155
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:43,130
the changes file and somewhere
here the virtual

156
00:09:43,297 --> 00:09:44,540
machine with its plugins.
