00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.840 align:middle
Hello, in this sequence we'll look
at the SUnit test framework in Pharo,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.720 align:middle
which allow us to write unit tests,
as you're going to see.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.200 align:middle
A test framework is used
to support Agile development.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.560 align:middle
The idea is to do incremental
development and to test

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.720 align:middle
your code regularly to check

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.240 align:middle
that in modifying it we haven't broken
a property or invariant in the code.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.240 align:middle
We want to be prepared for changes.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle
We write tests then we modify our codes

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle
then we can re-execute the tests

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle
to check we haven't broken or modified
anything we shouldn't have.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.520 align:middle
Automated tests are very important
in supporting this kind of programming.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle
The SUnit framework is
a special framework for writing tests.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.400 align:middle
It makes them easier to write.
It's in 4 classes, it's very simple.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.960 align:middle
It was originally
developed by Kent Beck,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle
and has inspired numerous tests
in other languages,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.040 align:middle
like JUnit, for example.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.440 align:middle
So, what is a test?

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.080 align:middle
There are 3 steps to writing a test:

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.960 align:middle
Step one, we create a context,
for example, an empty set.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.480 align:middle
Step two, I create a stimulus,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.960 align:middle
here, so I try to insert
an element twice

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle
in the set I've just created,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.760 align:middle
and step three,
I test the result that I get,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.160 align:middle
which means that I wait until
the set only contains one element.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle
A set object can only contain
an element once.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.680 align:middle
It can't contain it twice.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.520 align:middle
Then I test the result,
hoping the variant isn't broken.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.320 align:middle
Here's an example.
To write a test...

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle
I have to write a TestCase subclass.
I'll call this one "SetTestCase".

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle
It's to test the sets.
I define the method, "testAdd".

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.240 align:middle
All the methods begin with "test".

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.960 align:middle
Then I set up the context,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle
I create an instance
of the Set class, which is empty,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle
I add 2 elements,
the same element twice...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.240 align:middle
I try and add the same element twice

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle
to the bundle,
so 5 twice, here and here.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.000 align:middle
Then I test it, I've "check" here,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.600 align:middle
I use "assert" to do this,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.840 align:middle
where I check that the size of my set

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.480 align:middle
is 1, that I've succeeded
in only adding the element once.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle
I can start the test thanks to this...

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.280 align:middle
Thanks to this expression,
so my test will reveal

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle
if the variance, if "assert",
the expression passed here, is true.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle
All the methods that begin

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.960 align:middle
with the string "test" represent a test,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.640 align:middle
and will be automatically executed
by the test runner tool.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle
We'll see that all the results,
all the executions of the test method

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle
produce a result.
All these results are collected,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle
and they're collected within
a class instance object, TestResult.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle
I'll give you another example.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle
In this example, we've the test method,
its name begins with "test"

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle
in lowercase, and this
is the name of this method,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle
"AdjacentRunsWithEquals
AttributesAreMerged"

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.960 align:middle
So we've the context here,
we've created an object.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle
Here we've a stimulus.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle
We've tried to send the message
"addLast times"

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle
to this object 3 times,
the 1st time with

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.880 align:middle
the settings here,
and a 2nd time, the same settings

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.640 align:middle
the 2nd and 3rd time.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle
We test here, it's the check,

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle
that this element is size 2.
All right?

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.960 align:middle
We weren't able to add the same
element several times adjacently.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.320 align:middle
In the execution of a test,
several scenarios can occur.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.720 align:middle
One scenario is what we call
a "failure", meaning that

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle
one of the assertions,
a variant we thought was true,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.560 align:middle
which should be true is false,
in which case

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.560 align:middle
the test which contains "failure"

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.600 align:middle
is an anticipated problem.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.240 align:middle
We expected that, potentially,
this error would be present.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle
After that, an error is a condition
we didn't check for.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle
It's something that happens,
an exception that's raised,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.480 align:middle
which we didn't expect
when writing the test.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle
They're 2 very different cases.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle
What do we do in a test
when we want to check

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle
that a bit of code
raises an exception?

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle
For example, I want to check
that "set new remove: 1"

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle
this bit of code,
will raise the exception "NotFound".

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle
If I do "Set new", it's an empty set.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle
I'm trying to take an element
from an empty set.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.600 align:middle
It doesn't make sense.
It will raise the exception "NotFound"

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.800 align:middle
and in my test I use "should raise".

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.600 align:middle
I pass a block
and in my evaluation of the block,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.240 align:middle
if an exception is raised,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle
and the exception is NotFound,
the test will be green, will be OK.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle
I can also test the reverse,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.680 align:middle
that a bit of code doesn't
raise an exception.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.440 align:middle
Here I use the method
"self shouldn't raise".

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.880 align:middle
So this bit of code shouldn't
raise the exception "NotFound".

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle
We might, when writing lots of tests,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.480 align:middle
realise that there are duplicates

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle
when writing the context of the test.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle
For example,
here I've written another test

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.120 align:middle
for the sets, a "testOccurrences".

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.800 align:middle
We see that here, in the context,
I'm going to recreate a new empty set.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle
Each time I write a test, I open a set,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle
and each time I'll do
"Set new" in the context.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.920 align:middle
We'd like not to repeat this line
every time in all of our tests.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.120 align:middle
To not have to repeat them,
to be able to factor it out

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.080 align:middle
somewhere else, we have a solution.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.280 align:middle
The SUnit solution
is to use the method "setUp"

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.160 align:middle
to factor out all the initializations
before execution of a test.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.680 align:middle
So what actually happens is,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle
at the moment a test is executed,
just before a test,

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle
therefore a method starting
with the test string, is executed,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.760 align:middle
we'll trigger execution
of the method "setUp",

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.200 align:middle
and specify the context.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.320 align:middle
During the test we'll use the stimuli

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle
and the check, the assertions,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.200 align:middle
and at the end
of the execution of the test

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.360 align:middle
whether it fails or not,

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle
we'll execute the method "tearDown",

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.960 align:middle
which will allow us to clean up

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle
all the resources that
should be released.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle
If we look at the execution
of several test methods, it's easy,

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle
we'll have the execution of "setUp"

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.720 align:middle
the first test method executed here,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.360 align:middle
the execution of "tearDown" to clean,
a new execution of "setUp"

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.720 align:middle
the execution of a new test,
"tearDown", "setUp",

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle
the execution of a test
and "tearDown'.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle
This allows us to factorize
implementation of the context,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.040 align:middle
and clean up resources in two methods,
"setUp" and "tearDown".

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.560 align:middle
What does it look like?

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle
In our example,
if I take "SetTestCase"

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.640 align:middle
I can put in place
"define setUp method",

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.320 align:middle
in which I write,
"empty :=Set new",

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle
so "empty" becomes an instance
variable of "SetTestCase",

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle
and then in my test,
in my test method,

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle
I can directly use
the instance variable "empty",

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.880 align:middle
which was correctly initialized,
because before execution

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.800 align:middle
of "testOccurence"
the method "setUp" was executed.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.040 align:middle
If we look at the organisation
of the classes

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.600 align:middle
within the core of SUnit,
as I said, there are only 4 classes:

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.440 align:middle
so one test case,
which is nothing more nor less

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.560 align:middle
than a test that verifies
that certain conditions,

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.000 align:middle
are true in a given context,
so one test case has

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.280 align:middle
one "setUp" method
one "tearDown" method

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.840 align:middle
and then a group of test methods.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.480 align:middle
We write a "new" all the time,
the subclasses of the test case.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle
These test cases are combined

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle
in a "TestSuite",

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.560 align:middle
and we can launch the execution
of a complete suite.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.640 align:middle
When we launch the execution
of a suite we get a result,

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.040 align:middle
and this result is an instance
of "testResult" here,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle
which tells us
how many tests have passed,

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle
how many tests have been executed,
how many have potentially

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.240 align:middle
met with failures and errors.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.560 align:middle
We also have the notion
of "TestResource"

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle
which allows us to define
the TestResources for a whole suite.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.760 align:middle
A TestCase, as I said,
represents one test.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.040 align:middle
It's one method starting with "test"
defined in a subclass, TestCase.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle
A TestSuite is a group of tests.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.320 align:middle
It's all the TestCase methods
defined in one or several classes.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.880 align:middle
And a TestResult will be a result
of several test executions.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.040 align:middle
A TestResource
is an object that will enable

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.120 align:middle
the initialization
of a group of resources,

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.520 align:middle
which are costly
to initialize in normal time,

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.280 align:middle
and which we only want to
initialize once for a group of tests.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.400 align:middle
We set up a TestResource, initialize
it once and execute lots of tests,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle
and then we can release it at the end.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.320 align:middle
What you should know

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle
is how to write tests.
Writing tests is extremely simple,

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.480 align:middle
you just have to write a subclass
of the TestCase class,

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.240 align:middle
define the methods in it
which begin with "test",

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle
and then set up a context inside it,

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.960 align:middle
send the stimuli and test
the assertions, which should be true.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle
We'll reuse the contexts,

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.240 align:middle
so you can reuse the contexts
through several test methods,

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.640 align:middle
by factorizing them
in a SetUp method for example.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.080 align:middle
To summarize, in this sequence
we've seen the SUnit test framework,

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.360 align:middle
which is extremely simple to use,

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.560 align:middle
and extremely efficient
for setting up Agile developments.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle
I strongly urge you to use them,
defining tests is very easy.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.840 align:middle
The big advantage is that when
you've created one test

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.400 align:middle
you can run it a million times
and it's really handy for making sure

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle
that your code still works,
even if you've changed things,

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.640 align:middle
and edge effects have occured,
you can detect them

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle
if you've been up-to-date
enough in the tests you've written.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle
You can go further in creating tests
by using dot frameworks,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.640 align:middle
typically Mock frameworks
like BabyMock, etc...

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle
to have different
styles of test and test writing.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.720 align:middle
I encourage you to use and create
a lot of tests in your program.
