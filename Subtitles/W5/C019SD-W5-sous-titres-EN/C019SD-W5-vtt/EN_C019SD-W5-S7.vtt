00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.440 align:middle
Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.240 align:middle
In this sequence we'll look at
the API for manipulating files.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.280 align:middle
What we'll be looking at particularly

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.760 align:middle
is how to navigate between files,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.640 align:middle
how to create and remove files,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.400 align:middle
how to list files in the directories,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.120 align:middle
and how to read from
and write to files.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.720 align:middle
To begin with,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.240 align:middle
we need an entry point
in the file system,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.440 align:middle
there are many.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle
With "FileLocator home"
you have the user directory,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.880 align:middle
"FileLocator root" you have the root

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle
of the directory system.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.120 align:middle
With "FileLocatorC" in Windows
you have disc C:

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.160 align:middle
Once you have a directory,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle
these 3 elements are directories,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.680 align:middle
I take one, "FileLocator home"

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.040 align:middle
in which I have
the user home directory.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.160 align:middle
From there I can say,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle
"Give me your access path".

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.480 align:middle
So "home" isn't a string,
it's an object that represents

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.960 align:middle
a directory and I can say,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle
"Give me the string
locating you in the system".

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.120 align:middle
So that's "home/cassou".

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle
I can ask a directory
where its children are.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.880 align:middle
"What are all the files
and directories you contain?"

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.960 align:middle
Here it tells me, in "home".

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.640 align:middle
I've a file named .bashrc,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.040 align:middle
and I've a Music directory.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 align:middle
So this, "children",

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle
returns a bundle of objects,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.080 align:middle
which are files and directories.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.080 align:middle
If we play a bit more with this API,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.160 align:middle
we'll see the method "/",

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.000 align:middle
When we send the message /

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle
to a directory we can indicate
a particular child that interests us.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle
So "home/'Music'"
gives me the Music directory.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.880 align:middle
By sending the message
"directories" to a file,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle
I get all the sub files.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.080 align:middle
Here I see that, in my Music library,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.400 align:middle
I have a file Anouar_Brahem.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.360 align:middle
The parent message allows me
to go up a rung,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.320 align:middle
so if I'm in the Music file,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle
I send "parent" but I return
to my "home" file.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle
Leaving my directory

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle
"Music", as we saw before,
I'll try to create a directory.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.000 align:middle
To do this, I check
if the directory exists.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle
By sending a message "isDirectory"

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle
I see whether it exists or not.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.000 align:middle
This says it doesn't exist.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.560 align:middle
All right, I create it with
"ensureCreateDirectory".

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.840 align:middle
Then I test it, "do you exist?"
In this case it exists,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.520 align:middle
with "delete" I can erase it,
and I check it's deleted

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle
by sending ""isDirectory".

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle
To find

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.120 align:middle
all the children in a directory,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.280 align:middle
there are several methods.
I'll show you two.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle
We send a message,
"allChildrenMatching" to a directory,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle
and by passing it an expression

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.120 align:middle
that's typical of the ladder
and which represents

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle
the name of the directory we expect,
so with "*.ogg",

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.520 align:middle
I want all the files to have
the extension ".ogg".

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.280 align:middle
That will return all my music files
to .ogg in my Pink Floyd directory.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.680 align:middle
I can do the same thing
in a more long-winded way.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.640 align:middle
By sending the message
"allChildren" I get all the children

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.960 align:middle
all the files and directories,
in a particular directory,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle
and I filter with the message "select"

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.880 align:middle
all those whose name ends in ".ogg".

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.080 align:middle
"Basename" returns the string
representing the file name

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.360 align:middle
and I want the file name
to end in .ogg.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle
These two bits of code
are almost the same.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle
How do we get information about a file?

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.280 align:middle
How do we create a file from a string?

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle
I've a file name, "asFileReference",

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle
which turns my file name
into a reference towards a file.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle
It can be an existing
or a non-existent file, I don't know.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle
Let's look at the message
"isFile" at this reference.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.600 align:middle
I'll get "true" if it exists
and "false" if it doesn't.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle
By sending the message "basename",
I get the name of the file.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle
By sending "extension"
I get the file extension,

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle
with "size" I get the size,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle
and with "PathString",
as we saw before,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.160 align:middle
I get the access path
in the form of a string.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.680 align:middle
Now let's see how to write to
and read from a file. To write,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.240 align:middle
first of all, I take
a reference towards a file.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle
Here, I check that it doesn't exist.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.720 align:middle
We can write to a file that exists,
I'm checking it doesn't exist.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.400 align:middle
I write to it.
To write, I create a stream.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle
With "nextPutAll"

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle
I ask to write each character
of the stream to the file.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.680 align:middle
At the end I close my stream
to ensure that the system

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle
has written everything to the disc.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.640 align:middle
Conversely, I can read

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.680 align:middle
from a file,
so I take the same file and .txt.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.400 align:middle
I check it exists, and it does,
because I can write to it.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.920 align:middle
I create a "ReadStream"

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle
and I look, either character
by character by sending "next".

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.480 align:middle
With the message "next" I'll get,
"h" then "e" then "l", etc...

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.240 align:middle
I do "next" once, I get "h".

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle
Afterwards I'll pick up everything,

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle
from the first "h" I've just read
to the end of the file.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle
Here I get "ello World"
without the "h".

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.120 align:middle
At the end, I send "stream close"
to the stream object,

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.440 align:middle
to ensure the file reference is closed.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.440 align:middle
We can write these codes more simply,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle
without having the need

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle
to send the "close" message.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle
We might forget to send
the "close" message.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.200 align:middle
There can be an exception
that means "close" is never sent.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.720 align:middle
In general, we try to avoid
having to write it ourselves.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle
To do this, to write,

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle
I take my file reference,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle
I send the message "writeStreamDo",

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.400 align:middle
which takes a block in parentheses,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.400 align:middle
the block takes one stream
in parentheses.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.280 align:middle
This stream will be automatically
provided by "writeStreamDo"

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.040 align:middle
which will create a
"writeStream" on the file.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.840 align:middle
The only thing I need to do is,
by using this stream,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.960 align:middle
manipulate the stream
to do what I want with the file.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.560 align:middle
I'll write 'Hello World' to the file,
"stream nextPutAll: 'Hello World'".

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.080 align:middle
When the block finishes,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle
the stream closes automatically,
and the file writes to the disc.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.040 align:middle
Same principle for reading,
I put "readStreamDo".

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.480 align:middle
Here I have a stream,
I can do what I want with it.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.000 align:middle
I decide to retrieve
the contents of the stream.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.920 align:middle
What you should know,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle
is that files and directories
are references,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle
they're references towards
files and directories on the disc

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.880 align:middle
that may or may not exist.
Check with "isFile", "isDirectory"

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle
if the files exist on the disc.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle
The API is simple,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.120 align:middle
and facilitates navigation
and manipulation of the files.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.120 align:middle
We can read from and write to files
through streams,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.480 align:middle
and with an API

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle
which will close the stream
automatically at the end.
