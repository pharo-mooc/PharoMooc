00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,800
Hello, this is the final chapter
in our journey into the world of Pharo.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,280
It will complete the courses
we have presented.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,600
It's important to understand

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,160
that the hard part is over
now you know the key aspects of Pharo.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,080
We've covered pretty much everything,

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,080
except some
software engineering concepts,

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,640
like package dependency
and continuous integration.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,400
You'll find them on www.pharo.org.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,480
You will have learned
almost all of the core libraries.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,600
There are others,
but they are extensions,

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,800
which have the same level of complexity.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,840
For these, you'll need to learn
the specific libraries.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,680
I hope you see Pharo
as an immersive system.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,760
It allows you
to constantly interact with objects.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,920
Particularly by coding in the debugger.

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,960
The debugger is a key to productivity,
so make sure you use it!

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,320
There's also another important aspect.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,760
If you use Pharo for business,
contact us if you need help.

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,560
Pharo is a community of people
who do business in a concrete way.

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,200
Pharo is a young language
that is evolving.

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,240
Infrastructure is constantly improving,

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,160
as in its compiler, tools, and libraries.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,480
Our community
is also constantly growing.

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,640
This slide shows Pharo's mid-term vision
with a list of projects in development

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,520
that will be realized in a year or two.

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,040
Briefly, these include scripting syntax,

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,240
an improved module system,

28
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,080
integration with versioning systems,

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,280
and integration with OSes.

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,920
All these features will be completed
within two years.

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,400
Today, Pharo is no longer
a small team working in France.

32
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,000
We have 70 regular contributors
across the globe who improve Pharo.

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,080
This community works on
numerous projects.

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,760
We don't even know what they all are!

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,000
Our message
is that you can participate, too.

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,160
You can take on a project
with other people.

37
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,200
It's very rewarding on many levels.

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,520
You can contribute to the system
and it's fun!

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,360
I hope you enjoyed this journey
and learned a lot.

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,800
I hope Pharo helps you to reflect
on the future of programming.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,280
Everything is accessible in Pharo.

42
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,160
It allows you to do things
you can't do elsewhere.

43
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,000
But Pharo is more than that!
It's fun and elegant.

44
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,320
It's simple and pure.

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,560
Pharo is fantastic for developers
who want to program practical things.

46
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,080
For teaching objects, it's tops!
