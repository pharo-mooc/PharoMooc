Hello. In this session,
we will learn about return.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,440
How can you return a value

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,600
from a block or method?

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,840
And what are the default return values?

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,840
There are four cases to study:

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,640
a method which uses the caret to return,

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,080
a method without the caret,

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,720
a block with the caret,

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,000
and a block without the caret.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,040
In a method,

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,120
if you use the caret to return a value,

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,120
here, it will return

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,160
a specific value.

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,920
It will exit the method.

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,640
If I don't use the caret,

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,680
the method returns self by default.

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,720
This part is optional.
You don't usually write it.

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,640
The return value of a block
is its last expression.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,720
In the case of this block,

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,120
between these, I have a block

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,960
which takes a value x as a parameter.

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,200
I add 33 to x.

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,560
The value, the result
of this expression x+33

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,120
is not used, so it was erased.

25
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,640
The following instruction is x+2,
so I add 2 to the value x.

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,040
As it's the block's last expression,

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,720
its value

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,960
represents the return value
of the block.

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,800
So my block, value:5.

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,800
It means I execute the block

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,360
with x taking the value 5.

32
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,800
So I compute 33+5;

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,840
the result gets erased,
since it's useless.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,840
5+2 gives the value 7

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,480
which is used
as the block's return value.

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,360
So the entire expression's value is 7.

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,440
If I use the caret in a block,

38
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,400
the behavior is totally different
from a method.

39
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,320
You shouldn't expect
the block to be terminated,

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,440
but the method.

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,120
Let's look at the example
of the method factorial

42
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,760
in the class Integer.

43
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,800
There's one return here and one there.

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,040
These two returns
terminate the method's execution.

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,920
So if the receiver self is zero

46
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,480
during the execution of the method,

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,680
the block is executed,

48
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,160
1 is immediately returned,
and the method will terminate.

49
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,080
So the method returns 1.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,360
return is not used to terminate
the block but the embracing method.

51
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,720
In the second example,
if self is bigger than zero,

52
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,000
you compute with a recursive call

53
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,400
and immediately return the result.

54
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,520
So the method
doesn't continue to execute

55
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,360
when self is bigger than zero.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,480
In the other cases,
if you reach the third instruction,

57
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,760
you get an error message, meaning
that the receiver is a negative number.

58
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,280
You should remember

59
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,560
that the caret allows you
to terminate the method

60
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,760
whether caret is located in the method
or in the block in the method.

61
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,240
The caret always terminates the method

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,200
and returns a value
specified after the caret.

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,280
By default, a method returns self.

64
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,720
It's useless to write method self
at the end

65
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,920
as it is the value
which is returned by default.

66
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,240
A block returns the result
of its last expression.
