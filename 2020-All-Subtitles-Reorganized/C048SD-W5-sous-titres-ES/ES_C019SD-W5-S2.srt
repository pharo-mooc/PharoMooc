1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,800
Hello. In this course

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,440
we'll take the time to really
understand the class methods.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,960
You should have done the exercise
with the counter,

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,520
you have done a class method,
it worked very well.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,440
Now we'll take a good look,
so you understand for once and all.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,800
You'll learn in this course
that there's no difference in Pharo

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,240
between class and instance methods
on a search algorithm level.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,320
There's only one search algorithm

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,400
alluded to and used,
that's defined in the virtual machine,

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,240
and you'll see that, while we could
have said that the class methods,

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,320
at first glance, are like static
Java methods, they're not.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,200
In fact, they are dynamically linked.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,600
There's a search at execution,

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,080
while in Java, typically,
static methods aren't dynamically sought.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,720
Let's see how it works.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,680
In fact, what you've seen

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,600
is that there's only one lookup,
which starts in the receiver's class.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,600
If the method is defined in the class,

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,000
it's returned, otherwise
it continues in the superclass.

20
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,560
What this means, graphically,

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,720
is that I've my example
of the Counter class.

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,880
When I send the increment message,
what will happen?

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,160
Step 1, I look in the Counter class,
and I'll go back up...

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,040
If I've "increment" it's defined here,

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,120
if it's a method defined
higher up in the hierarchy

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,120
it will be sought higher up.

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,760
In fact, this mechanism is used
in Pharo, there's only one,

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,280
it's used for both instances and classes.

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,640
When you did the exercise with
the class counter and sent the message

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,320
"with value" to the class counter

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,480
to create an instance, what happened?

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,960
The class counter is instance
of a class called "Counter class"

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,400
and we looked, we used
the same method as before.

34
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,600
We looked in the receiver class,
the receiver was "Counter",

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,920
so we looked in the class
"Counter class" and found the method

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,960
"with value" which we applied
to the receiver

37
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,680
and it gave us a new instance.

38
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,760
So we used exactly the same process
as for the messages we sent

39
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,960
to an instance of the Counter class.

40
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,560
So what is a "class" in Pharo?
A class is an instance.

41
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,480
It's an object like any object.
In Pharo there are only objects.

42
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,040
A class is an instance
of another class, called a metaclass.

43
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,000
It's just to distinguish them.
A metaclass is just a class

44
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,080
whose instances are classes,

45
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,680
to differentiate between
terminal instances and classes.

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,680
The next thing is that
the Counter class, in this line,

47
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,040
the Counter class is the only instance
of the class Counter class.

48
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,640
This Counter class is created
automatically, without you knowing it.

49
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,040
When you defined the Counter class,
the system automatically created

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,960
the class Counter class,
and it created the Counter class.

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,040
You thought you were creating 1 class,
but in fact you were creating 2.

52
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,640
What you have to know in Pharo
is that all the classes

53
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,680
in a class called XXX
are called XXX class.

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,120
So if I have Counter,
the Counter class will be

55
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,080
Counter class, systematically.

56
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,680
So, in fact, what you do in reality,

57
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,920
we're just showing you how it works.
We needn't have explained it,

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,800
but it means that when
the browser shows you

59
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,560
the Counter class, it shows you

60
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,240
the code that will be executed
on the instances of this class.

61
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
That means, "increment"

62
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,840
is the code that will be executed
on this instance here.

63
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,280
When you click on the "class" button
to define a class method,

64
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,800
it shows you the code that will be
executed on this object here.

65
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,000
And in fact, if we look,
when I send the message "increment"

66
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,680
to the counter instance,
I'll look in the Counter class.

67
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,240
Look, that's the method executed.

68
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,360
When I send the message
"with value" to the Counter class,

69
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,800
where will I look? In its class.
I follow this link,

70
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,040
and it's this method here.

71
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,000
So what should you know?

72
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,320
A class is an object in Pharo.

73
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,960
A class can receive messages.

74
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,680
I told you when we did the syntax,

75
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,720
I told you date, today...

76
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,680
What's that? It's a message
that we sent to a class.

77
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,040
There are no elements
syntaxed differently.

78
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,040
It's the same as sending a message
syntactically to an instance.

79
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,640
What's more, this course shows you,
there's only one method lookup.

80
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,760
The class methods
are looked up dynamically

81
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,520
like the instance methods.
Where are they looked up?

82
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,560
In the class of the receiver.

83
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,520
When it's an instance,
it's looked up in the class,

84
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,800
when it's an instance class
like the Counter class

85
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,880
it's looked up in the metaclass,
in the class called Counter class.

86
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,520
So a class is an instance
of another class, called a metaclass,

87
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,560
and only one look up works.

88
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,480
So we'll return to this notion
in the final session,

89
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,640
in the lecture
Understanding Metaclasses

90
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,040
and we're going to revisit,
we're going to lift the lid on Pharo

91
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,080
and show you how it works,
and it's completely uniform.
